## üéí 1. Project Summary
* Our project uncovers patterns in NFT trading for three NFT collections.
    * Part One : [*Boyed Ape Yatch Club*](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/)
    * Part Two : [*Azuki*](https://www.azuki.com)
    * Part Three : [*Cryptopunks*](http://larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)
* We'll examine relationships between types of:
    * Art and customers
    * Purchase prices and timestamps
    * Trends in purchases over time
    * Historical Volume 
    * Purchase prices
    * Trends in sales
    * Transaction data ie. transaction fees paid for all collections
    * Other related questions as the data admits

## üé© 2. Hypothesis
* Should you invest in Azuki, BAYC or Crypto Punks? 
    * What are people paying for NFT in USD value?
    * How much in fees are being paid per transaction?
    * Is the value appreciating or declining?
* How can you tell which collection is performing well?
    * What is the daily transaction volume after Collection is released?

## üß§ 3. Data Collection & Cleanup
* How do we collect NFT data?
    - [x] Covalent APIs
    - [x] Etherscan API
    - [x] Other Dependancies ie. Plotly Express
    ![APIs and Imports](./exports/png/nft_analysis.png)
* Why cleanup data?
    * Prepare data for analysis
    * Isolate the types of data we are interested in from the rest
    * See what the customer data look like
    * Evaluate performance

## ü¶∫ 4. Analysis

* What kind of data we like to work with and the field we're interested in 
    * Market Caps
    * Transaction data
    * NFT art trading sales
    * Gas Prices prices
    * Price volatility
    * Collections
    * Token IDs
    * Contract addresses
    * NFT Owners
    * Global view of NFT Marketplace
    * Wrapped tokens
    * Major Exchanges that process NFT transactions

## ‚õëÔ∏è 5. Postmoterm
* Did we find everything we expected to find?
    - [x] What are our difficulties
        * Concating data from multiple data sources
        * Data cleanups
        * Choosing data to plot
        * Selecting appropriate plots to display data
        * Using unfarmiliar libraries
    - [x] How did we deal with them
        * Googling
        * Stackoverflow
        * Reading official documentation
        * Consulting instructor
        * Asking tutors
    - [x] Additional questions that came up  that we would research next if we had more time
        * Global NFT market sales comparison
        * Burned tokens vs Active tokens
        * How can we separate authentic sales from suspicious NFT transactions?
    
## üé§ 6. Discussion

* After we've analyzed our data to our satisfaction, we'll put together a presentation to show off our work, explain our process, and discuss our conclusions.
* This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and it would give our classmates and instructional staff an overview of our work.
